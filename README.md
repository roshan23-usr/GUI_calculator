# GUI_calculator
How it Works:
The user enters values for principal, interest rate, compounding frequency, and years in the input fields.

Upon clicking "Calculate", the program calculates the compound interest and displays the result in a message box.

If the user enters invalid data (like a letter instead of a number), an error message will pop up asking for valid input.
